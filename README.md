# C++ Linear Algebra Lirary

## Eigen

> [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.

Support:

* Standard C++98
* [Explicit vectorization](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=FAQ#Vectorization):
   > for SSE 2/3/4, AVX, AVX2, FMA, AVX512, ARM NEON (32-bit and 64-bit), PowerPC AltiVec/VSX (32-bit and 64-bit), ZVector (s390x/zEC13) SIMD instruction sets, and since 3.4 MIPS MSA with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code.
* Widely used: (need to confirm) TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy (Optional), ...
* Free software
* ...

Prerequirements:

```sh
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```
